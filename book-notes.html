          <p>A smart read, <i> Doing Data Science</i> offers insight to the growing field of Data Science. It attempts to give a structured definition to the field while allowing for flexibility in practice. Modeled after their graduate course taught at Columbia University, O’Neil and Schutt do a wonderful job of showing how this field encompasses a wide variety of specialists across industry and academia. The book offers three main ways to introduce the reader to Data Science- technical methods, situational modeling, and outsider interviews. Writing the book in this fashion allows for the authors to cohesively demonstrate just how interdisciplinary Data Science is. Through offering a sketch of creating a Bayes classifier with corresponding examples allows for the reader to experience Data Science as a student. By giving motivating examples, the reader is able to experience Data Science as a practitioner. Finally, the reader gets to see a practicing Data Science talk about her/his work. All of these pieces allow the reader to understand how broad this field really is. </p><p>This, for me, was a very freeing observation that was built into the structure of the book. I was not reading this book for a technical overview of the methods. While I did enjoy these portions, I wanted a real taste for what the practicing professionals in both academia and industry do on a day to day basis. Like most everything in this field, the answer to that question depends. Data Scientists are at investment banks, the New York Journal, non profits, physics labs, and so so so many more places I’d never expect to find them. It doesn’t matter what you do- the way in which you do it determines if you are a data scientist or not. 
          </p><p>We are in an age of vast information and data. A Data Scientist is a person who uses their data effectively and ethically. Almost every field will need a Data Scientist in the coming years. Or better yet, every domain expert will have at least a small Data Scientist in them. This book reminded me of the power and capabilities of the methods we have developed- and that we are just on the brink of actually unlocking the power of the information we already have. </p>

          <p>Cory Doctorow’s novel on the copyright structure in American artistic venues was an eye opening and informative read. With deep understanding of copyright law and technologies enforcing these laws, Doctorow informs, guides, and teaches the reader how to not only understand the past of copyright law in America, but helps open a conversation to evaluate the current position of ownership in the information age. The author also spends a great deal of the novel articulating that this battle of <i>copy</i> is not nearly as trivial as it once was. If I ripped of a record in the 1980s, it wasn’t a big deal. Today, however, if I break a digital lock, I open a door to not only my device, but any device like it. Since all technology is now built with some form of computing nucleus, breaking into a toaster remotely may open the door to cutting the breaks to your car remotely as well. As we ascend into an age where censorship and connectivity is at an all time high, we must ask ourselves before, during, and after development how our choices will affect the greater technological ecosystem- a problem unique to the digital age.</p><p>The reason I picked up this book is because of my high school band director- a music fanatic who insisted on purchasing every single album he wished to listen. At first, I thought this was noble, paying for a service. Then I thought it was downright stupid, seeing how these mainstream musicians we listen to all ready make millions of dollars on concerts and swag. This book has begun to clear away my confusion and replace it with an intricate dicussion. Doctorow has made one point abundantly clear- the creator to consumer pipeline is riddled with middlemen who treat consumers like criminals and creators like shit. If a consumer wants music on a different platform or to enjoy it in a different way, these middlemen have the right to block, fine, sue, and ban this behavior for a service the consumer has all ready paid for. The creators meanwhile shop themselves in a wildly competitive market to only a few agencies. Simple supply and demand show why the creators make little and why breaking through to the top of the industry takes more luck than anything. If we look to move forward to a collective and wide market of creators and consumers, we need to clear this pipeline. There are several ways in which copyright can be changed to not only aid this pipeline but decrease the security risks associated with policing consumers as they partake in a creator's art. Doctorow’s book was a fascinating read that anyone interested in where the information age is taking our society should consider picking up. </p>
