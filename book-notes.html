<p>Cory Doctorow’s novel on the copyright structure in American artistic venues was an eye opening and informative read. With deep understanding of copyright law and technologies enforcing these laws, Doctorow informs, guides, and teaches the reader how to not only understand the past of copyright law in America, but helps open a conversation to evaluate the current position of ownership in the information age. The author also spends a great deal of the novel articulating that this battle of <i>copy</i> is not nearly as trivial as it once was. If I ripped of a record in the 1980s, it wasn’t a big deal. Today, however, if I break a digital lock, I open a door to not only my device, but any device like it. Since all technology is now built with some form of computing nucleus, breaking into a toaster remotely may open the doors to cutting your breaks remotely as well. As we ascend into an age where censorship and connectivity is at an all time high, we must ask ourselves before, during and after development how our choices will affect the greater technological ecosystem- a problem unique to the digital age.</p><p>The reason I picked up this book is because of my high school band director- a music fanatic who insisted on purchasing every single album he wished to listen. At first, I thought this was noble, paying for a service. They I thought it was downright stupid, seeing how these mainstream musicians we listen to all ready make millions of dollars on concerts and swag. This book has begun to clear away the confusion around this statement. Doctorow has made one point abundantly clear- the creator to consumer pipeline is riddled with middlemen who treat consumers like criminals and creators like shit. If a consumer wants music on a different platform or to enjoy it in a different way, these middlemen have the right to block, fine, sue, and ban this behavior for a service the consumer has all ready paid for. The creators meanwhile shop themselves in a wildly competitive market to only a few agencies. Simple supply and demand show why the creators make little and why breaking through to the top of the industry takes more luck than anything. If we look to move forward to a collective and wide market of creators and consumers, we need to clear this pipeline. There are several ways in which copyright can be changed to not only aid this pipeline but decrease the security risks associated with policing the internet. Doctorow’s book was a fascinating read that anyone interested in where the information age is taking our society should consider picking up. </p>
