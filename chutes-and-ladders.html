<p>In this version of Chutes and Ladders, were are expanding the game to three dimensions. On the game board, a new space is added that elevates players to multiple levels of the grid. This movement is modulo though, so the “JStack” spaces are a gift and a curse. The major change to this project includes the addition of multiple tokens per player. Each player now has the choice to move one of n tokens on any given round. Our objective is to build AI personalities to win the game in an intelligent and efficient way.</p>

<p>
The scoring rewards players for finishing first and for the number of treasure pieces collected. Some of my initial thoughts for naive AI personalities include a random player, a treasure hunter, a sprinter, a hold miser, and an anti-hold player. These personalities will greatly differ in tactics and results. My initial findings will be posted soon after unit testing is completed.</p>

<p>Chutes and Ladders is a game I am currently working on in my Data Structures and Algorithms course. The initial game was played in two dimensions with each player having a single token (player piece). Instead of Chutes and Ladders, the players land in holds or are aided by spaces. As an introduction to data structures course, the players can land in either hold queues, priority queues, or simple hold spaces. The other spaces include treasure pots which allow for players to collect treasure along with the way to the finish.</p>

<p> My initial analysis answered the question “How should the board be configured such that the game ends within 50-100 turns.” In this analysis I built multi-regression models to predict the round totals of each game. Furthermore, basic n-way chi-squared tests were completed to see if player order affected the winner of the game (turns  out it doesn’t). These results can be found in my final report in my Chutes and Ladders repository.</p>
