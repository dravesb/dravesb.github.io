<p>Chutes and Ladders is a game I am currently working on in my Data Structures and Algorithms course. The initial game was played in two dimensions with each player having a single token (player piece). Instead of Chutes and Ladders, the players land in holds or are aided by spaces. As an introduction to data structures course, the players can land in either hold queues, priority queues, or simple hold spaces. The other spaces include treasure pots which allow for players to collect treasure along with the way to the finish.</p>

<p> My initial analysis answered the question “How should the board be configured such that the game ends within 50-100 turns.” In this analysis I built multi-regression models to predict the round totals of each game. Furthermore, basic n-way chi-squared tests were completed to see if player order affected the winner of the game (turns  out it doesn’t). These results can be found in my final report in my Chutes and Ladders repository.</p>
