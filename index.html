<p>My name is Benjamin Draves. I am a second year undergraduate at Lafayette College in Easton, PA studying mathematics, statistics, and computer science. This space is reserved for dialouge on my current projects as well as any surrounding developments in the aforementioned fields. Like many undergraduates, I work on several large scale projects for my courses that never my laptop. This site is a way for me to showcase my work to the public. For that reason, this site will hold several different types of proejcts. Simulation projects, statistical analyses, and those projects in which I complete both will all be posted here. While I will attempt to update this site with all of my current work, my consulting projects (e.g. Crayola, Easton City Schools, etc.) will never have mention on this site. If I fail to update regularly, you can suspsect I am working on one of these projects. I appreciate you taking the time to check out the site. If you wish to contact me about anything I am currently working on, please feel free to reach out. All of my contact information can be found under the <a href = "http://dravesb.github.io/contact">Contact</a> tab. Enjoy!</p>
<p>This site is in no way meant to be a formal blog or professional display. This site will, however, serve as a platform to share my thoughts and current work.</p>
