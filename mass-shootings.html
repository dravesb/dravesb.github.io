<p> Data is still being collected, but I still do not have enough to do a full analysis. I am continuing the data collection process with a growing number of tweets. I have begun to dig through the archive data but have nothing really interesting to put on the site (yet). I will dig deeper soon. I feel understanding the last three years will be very helpful while doing my full fledge analysis.</p>
<p> While I'm waiting on data- I feel its an appropriate time to discuss my long term plans for this data set and the ramifications of this data. As discussed below, I am looking to use LDA to do some topic modeling on the data. I have started to work through the original paper but have been moving slowely due to my course load. In addition to this, working through a three level bayesian model is also no easy feat. With that being said, I feel like to topic modeling application of LDA will be a perfect fit for this data set. Apart from that, I am looking to do some network analysis on the shootings (or if there is none, topics found via LDA) to connect events with one another. This will inlcude (possibly) using the Louvian method and eigenvector centrality. By modeling the text through a network, I think supplying an additional geometric understanding of the language will allow for a deeper understanding of how language changes. While these topics are relatively new to me, I feel as if doing an network analysis on these events and/or topics would be a great way to analyze this data set.</p>

<h3><a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Initial Data</h3>
<p>The first clean tweets are now available on my Github. I collected nearly 1,000 tweets over a five day period (3/30/16 - 4/2/16). In the very first tweet we see a reference to race. By glancing through the dataset, there appears to be some duplicates with some other minor annoyances (e.g. punctuation, unknown characters, etc.) that will need to be taken care of. A second scrap has currently started. I will continue to update the data page, and eventually have some graphics up on the archive data, as promised.</p>



<h3><a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Initial Updates</h3>
<p> As of 12:00p.m. 3/28/16 I have started collecting tweets containg the key phrase "mass-shooting." I plan to let this code run for one week in which I will parse the tweets and begin doing some low level analysis. This will be completed for the entire month of April. In the meantime, I am collecting the data from Shooting Tracker and will have some simple analysis soon. As far as the indepth models for my completed text corpus, I am looking to use latent Dirichlet allocation (lda) to complete my topic modeling. I am currently working through the orginial paper to understand the theoretical underpinings then hope to apply it to this text. </p>


<h3><a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motivation</h3>

<p>This project is based on my interest in the racial complexity surrounding mass shootings. Through the past ten years, the US has seen an incredible number of mass shootings. As these events increase in frequency, language has begun to emerge to discuss mass shootings. Before I discuss my interest and motivation in studying tweets surrounding mass shootings- I offer a working a definition. By the FBI standards a <b>mass shooting</b> is an open attack in which four or more people in a single incident (not including the shooter) are killed, typically in a single location. Sites like Shooting Tracker document these horrific events with pinpoint precision. My initial analysis will be a general modeling of the data made public by this site.</p>

<p>Following this initial analysis, I wish to look at the language surrounding these events. As the public adapts a language to discuss mass shootings, a natural vernacular is being adopted. In this adopted language, true, unfiltered thoughts of individuals have been scrutinized for racial slant, discrimination, or, at least, a way to highlight the racial divide in modern day America. My hypothesis, and subsequent fear, is that language surrounding these events is a function of the racial demographic of the communities involved and the racial profile of the shooter. A way (and most convenient way) to address this question is to analyze large text corpuses. I will be scraping Twitter to build this data base. From here, I plan to use frequency analysis and topic modeling techniques to understand how the language changes as the demographic of the affected communities change.</p>

<p>This analysis is of course dependent on the occurrence of a mass shooting (seeing that I will be scraping tweets live). I am currently collecting tweets to build baseline models that will be reimplemented and compared when data is collected during one of these mass shootings. If all is right with the world, I will never be able to collect the remaining data in order to finish this analysis. If this best case scenario does not occur, however, I want to find evidence that will help us advance the language around these sensitive and challenging topics.</p>
