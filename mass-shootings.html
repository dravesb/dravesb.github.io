<h3><a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Initial Data</h3>
<p>The first clean tweets are now available on my Github. I collected nearly 1,000 tweets over a five day period (3/30/16 - 4/2/16). In the very first tweet we see a reference to race. By glancing through the dataset, there appears to be some duplicates with some other minor annoyances (e.g. punctuation, unknown characters, etc.) that will need to be taken care of. A second scrap has currently started. I will continue to update the data page, and eventually have some graphics up on the archive data, as promised.</p>



<h3><a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Initial Updates</h3>
<p> As of 12:00p.m. 3/28/16 I have started collecting tweets containg the key phrase "mass-shooting." I plan to let this code run for one week in which I will parse the tweets and begin doing some low level analysis. This will be completed for the entire month of April. In the meantime, I am collecting the data from Shooting Tracker and will have some simple analysis soon. As far as the indepth models for my completed text corpus, I am looking to use latent Dirichlet allocation (lda) to complete my topic modeling. I am currently working through the orginial paper to understand the theoretical underpinings then hope to apply it to this text. </p>


<h3><a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motivation</h3>

<p>This project is based on my interest in the racial complexity surrounding mass shootings. Through the past ten years, the US has seen an incredible number of mass shootings. As these events increase in frequency, language has begun to emerge to discuss mass shootings. Before I discuss my interest and motivation in studying tweets surrounding mass shootings- I offer a working a definition. By the FBI standards a <b>mass shooting</b> is an open attack in which four or more people in a single incident (not including the shooter) are killed, typically in a single location. Sites like Shooting Tracker document these horrific events with pinpoint precision. My initial analysis will be a general modeling of the data made public by this site.</p>

<p>Following this initial analysis, I wish to look at the language surrounding these events. As the public adapts a language to discuss mass shootings, a natural vernacular is being adopted. In this adopted language, true, unfiltered thoughts of individuals have been scrutinized for racial slant, discrimination, or, at least, a way to highlight the racial divide in modern day America. My hypothesis, and subsequent fear, is that language surrounding these events is a function of the racial demographic of the communities involved and the racial profile of the shooter. A way (and most convenient way) to address this question is to analyze large text corpuses. I will be scraping Twitter to build this data base. From here, I plan to use frequency analysis and topic modeling techniques to understand how the language changes as the demographic of the affected communities change.</p>

<p>This analysis is of course dependent on the occurrence of a mass shooting (seeing that I will be scraping tweets live). I am currently collecting tweets to build baseline models that will be reimplemented and compared when data is collected during one of these mass shootings. If all is right with the world, I will never be able to collect the remaining data in order to finish this analysis. If this best case scenario does not occur, however, I want to find evidence that will help us advance the language around these sensitive and challenging topics.</p>
