<p>This model was completed in a Computation Simulation course completed January 2016. I was attempting to better understand how news traveled and the dissemination of news stories changed as a function of the political climate of the publishers. Especially during such political charged times in an election year, this model offers insight to how news travels and how news can be skewed to fit a certain political bias.</p>
<p> This problem was formalized in an agent based model context. These agents were news agencies and the readers of the news. News agencies would interact with other news agencies and release news to the readers in the population. Readers would then discuss the news and begin to read secondary accounts of the news from other news agencies. From these agent level interactions, system level trends were identified. </p>
<p>Simulated in Netlogo, this model was run several times with varying boundary conditions. Distributions of political bias of readers and news agencies, reader accountability, and political slander were carefully chosen. These justifications can be found in the paper in my github repository. A logistic model was built offering insights to how the agents behaved under the political climate. Generally, I found that as the number of news agencies and the popularity of the song increased, so did the log odds of the probability an agent would believe the story. Furthermore, I found that as the number of readers increased, there was a decrease in the log odds of a reader believing the story. To read more about the analysis, I encourage you to read the results section of my final paper.</p>
