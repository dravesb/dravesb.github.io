<p><a href="https://dravesb.github.io/presentation-slides/thesis_defense.pdf"> (Slides)</a> &nbsp These are the slides I used during my undergraduate honors thesis defense. The talk was an hour in length and I had the chance to talk through the specific details of each Treelet Covariance Smoother and their performance in simulation and real data applications.

<p> <a href="https://dravesb.github.io/presentation-slides/treelets-2-25-17.pdf"> (Slides)</a> &nbsp I presented at Moravian College as part of an undergraduate Mathematics conference. The talk was given to a group of my peers and I discussed some of the linear algebra driving Treelet Covariance Smoothers. I also showed a handful of simulation results and talked about the overarching ramifications of this type of research.

<p><a href="https://dravesb.github.io/presentation-slides/treelets-10-21-16.pdf"> (Slides)</a> &nbsp I gave this talk to a general academic community at Lafayette College in October 2016. The lunch-time panel talk was funded by EXCEL research committee. In this expository presentation, I gave a high level overview of the work I had completed over the summer and a brief overview of future work to be completed during the academic year.

<p><a href="https://dravesb.github.io/presentation-slides/treelets-6-29-1610.pdf"> (Slides)</a> &nbsp This talk was presented to the Lafayette College community in early Summer 2016. Funded by EXCEL research committee, I gave a high level presentation of the problem Dr. Gaugler and I were working on. In this presentation, I gave a review of established techniques in the literature as well as discussed my software package <a href="https://dravesb.github.io/PTrees">PTrees</a> &nbsp as a way to analyze the problem on a more granular level.

<p><a href="https://dravesb.github.io/presentation-slides/tot-bucknell.pdf"> (Slides)</a> &nbsp I had the opportunity to present at Bucknell University Digital Scholarship Conference in Lewisburg, PA in November 2015. My research partner, Vincent DeMarco, and I gave both an expository presentation and a digital poster presentation. Specifically, we discussed how we posed our problem in a statistics context and applied techniques in statistics, machine learning, and econometrics to analyze a naturally qualitative field - music.
