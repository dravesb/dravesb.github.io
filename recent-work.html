<p> My current work looks to collect tweets containg the key phrase "mass-shooting." There tragic events are occuring with increasing frequency and are haunting the American public. The media's depiction of these events have been a hot topic in the twittersphere and social media in general. This project looks to analyze the complexity of race and its effect on the language surrounding these horrific events. </p>

<p> This project looks to analyze the game Chutes and Ladders. While the game has traditionally been played exclusively with chutes and ladders, this project expands the historic game to include other aids and obstacles. Since the classic game has seen years of play, producers know how to structure the game rules to ensure the game finishes in a timely manor. With these new aids and obstacles a first question that surfaces is “How long does the game take?" Games like Monopoly and Risk are notorious for outlasting the patience of their players. To avoid this stigma, this project will look to find an optimal configuration to ensure the game finishes in 50-100 rounds. </p>

<p>This model looks to emulate the dissemination of political stories via new agencies that demonstrate a political bias or skew. With presidential elections swiftly approaching, several news agencies look to break stories about the candidates. These sources, however, may have favored certain parties historically, suggesting that their stories may either have a slant or perhaps contain unverified information. On the other side of the news market, readers themselves have political biases that affect how they perceive a story’s content. This interaction, between readers and news agencies, often leads to a partition of the population- those who believe the story, those who are skeptical, and those who are unsure. This model explores how a number of variables affects these end states. In doing so, this model offers a new insight to how political news is transmitted in a society with differing political preferences. </p>
