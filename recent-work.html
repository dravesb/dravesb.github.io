<p><a href="https://dravesb.github.io/treelet-smoothers"> Check it out!</a> &nbsp Treelet Smoothers is an R package currently in development. In my research with Professor Trent Gaugler, we have worked on smoothing methods using treelet decompositions to better estimate relatedness and narrow - sense heritability using GWAS panels. Established methodology (Treelet Covariance Smoothing), as well as our newly constructed methods (Treelet Covariance Blocking and Treelet Covariance Hybrid) have all been implemented. Using <i>GCTA</i>, smoothed estimates of heritability and relatedness can be obtained. In addition to these features, cross validation methods have been implemented. Again, this package is still under development.

<p><a href="http://dravesb.github.io/chutes-and-ladders"> Check it out!</a> &nbsp This project looks to analyze the game Chutes and Ladders. While the game has traditionally been played exclusively with chutes and ladders, this project expands the historic game to include other aids and obstacles. Since the classic game has seen years of play, producers know how to structure the game rules to ensure the game finishes in a timely manor. With these new aids and obstacles a first question that surfaces is “How long does the game take?" Games like Monopoly and Risk are notorious for outlasting the patience of their players. To avoid this stigma, this project will look to find an optimal configuration to ensure the game finishes in 50-100 rounds. </p>

<p><a href="http://dravesb.github.io/news-dissemination"> Check it out!</a> &nbsp This model looks to emulate the dissemination of political stories via new agencies that demonstrate a political bias or skew. With presidential elections swiftly approaching, several news agencies look to break stories about the candidates. These sources, however, may have favored certain parties historically, suggesting that their stories may either have a slant or perhaps contain unverified information. On the other side of the news market, readers themselves have political biases that affect how they perceive a story’s content. This interaction, between readers and news agencies, often leads to a partition of the population- those who believe the story, those who are skeptical, and those who are unsure. This model explores how a number of variables affects these end states. In doing so, this model offers a new insight to how political news is transmitted in a society with differing political preferences. </p>

<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a> Tempo of the Times</h3>
<p><a href="http://dravesb.github.io/tempo-of-the-times"> Check it out!</a> &nbsp Tempo of the Times was a project completed as a part of the Digital Humanities Scholar program. This project was born through close conversations with my friend and housemate, Vincent DeMarco. We looked to find a way to explore music as a function of the political climate. Tempo of the Times looks to connect social shifts with fundamental changes in musical compositions. Powered by the Echo Nest, this project uses macroeconomic metrics and musical metrics that vary in sophistication in an attempt understand how artist’s work change with respect to the societal climate. Statistical analysis, including regressive and ARIMA models, was completed to help understand these relationships. Through tempoofthtimes.com, visitors can view and download the datasets, use the interactive graphics to better understand the data, and explore the correlations and predictive models.

<p><a href="http://dravesb.github.io/risk"> Check it out!</a> &nbsp An implementation of AI to play the board game Risk. The game is formalized as an optimization problem in graph theory, where countries are represented as nodes in an undirected graph, and decisions are considered based on the graph properties. We introduce solution algorithms, with variable parametrizations, which are then implement as AIs with different personalities in JavaScript. We set up games among AIs to measure their performances, and discover unusual game strategies.
