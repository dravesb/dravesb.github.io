<p><a href="https://dravesb.github.io/treelet-smoothers"> Check it out!</a> &nbsp Treelet Smoothers is an R package currently in development. Treelet Covariance Smoothers is a class of methods that extend wavelets to non-smooth signals which, through a construction of multi-scale bases, uncover underlying structure in high dimensional, noisy data. These methods are used to improve the estimates of relatedness in GWAS. Established methodology (Treelet Covariance Smoothing - Crossett et al. 2013), as well as new methodologies (Treelet Covariance Blocking and Treelet Covariance Blocked Smoothing - Draves et al. under review) have all been implemented. In addition to these features, cross validation methodologies to choose optimal tuning parameters and visualizations of the hierarchical tree have been implemented.

<p><a href="https://dravesb.github.io/PTrees"> Check it out!</a> &nbsp To aide in the construction of new statistical methods in GWAS, it is extremely useful to be able to generate familial structures at scale. PTrees is a software tool that creates complex pedigree structures and randomly assigns genetic panels to the founders of the pedigree. From here, genetic material is passed down the tree. Users can input number of SNPS to be included, number of founders, probability of reproduction, maximum number of offspring, and number of families to be created. Using cranefoot - an independent software package - a plink formatted fam and a visualization of the pedigree are outputted in addition to the formatted bed file containing the genetic information.

<p><a href="http://dravesb.github.io/news-dissemination"> Check it out!</a> &nbsp This model looks to emulate the dissemination of political stories via news agencies that demonstrate a political bias or skew. With personal media platforms giving reporters the ability to reach their readership almost instantaneously, several news agencies look to break stories before their competitors. This hasty dynamic can lead to several false leads and inaccurate reporting. With lack of secondary checks, these reporter's sources may have overrepresented a viewpoint due to personal beliefs, suggesting that the reporter's stories may demonstrate a slant. On the other side of the news market, readers themselves have political biases that affect how they perceive a story’s content. This interaction, between readers and news agencies, often leads to a partition of the population- those who believe a story, those who are skeptical, and those who are unsure. This model explores how a number of variables affect these end states. In doing so, this model offers a new insight to how political news is transmitted in a society with differing political preferences. </p>

<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Chutes and Ladders</h3>
<p><a href="http://dravesb.github.io/chutes-and-ladders"> Check it out!</a> &nbsp This project looks to analyze the game Chutes and Ladders. While the game has traditionally been played exclusively with chutes and ladders, this project expands the historic game to include other aids and obstacles. Since the classic game has seen years of play, producers know how to structure the game rules to ensure the game finishes in a timely manor. With these new aids and obstacles a first question that surfaces is “How long does the game take?" Games like Monopoly and Risk are notorious for outlasting the patience of their players. To avoid this stigma, this project will look to find an optimal configuration to ensure the game finishes in 50-100 rounds. </p>

<p><a href="http://dravesb.github.io/tempo-of-the-times"> Check it out!</a> &nbsp Tempo of the Times was a project completed as a part of the Digital Humanities Scholar program at Lafayette College. This project was born through close conversations with my friend, Vincent DeMarco. We looked to find a way to explore music as a function of the political climate. Tempo of the Times looks to connect social shifts with fundamental changes in musical compositions. Powered by the Echo Nest, this project uses macroeconomic metrics and musical metrics that vary in sophistication in an attempt understand how artist’s work change with respect to the societal climate. Regressive and ARIMA models were constructed to help understand these relationships. Research was presented at Bucknell Digital Scholarship Conference and was accepted for presentation at NCUR 2016.

<p><a href="http://dravesb.github.io/risk"> Check it out!</a> &nbsp An implementation of AI to play the board game Risk. The game is formalized as an optimization problem in graph theory, where countries are represented as nodes in an undirected graph, and decisions are considered based on the graph properties. We introduce solution algorithms, with variable parametrizations, which are then implement as AIs with different personalities in JavaScript. We set up games among AIs to measure their performances, and discover unusual game strategies.
