<h3>Multiple Graph Embeddings</h3>
<p> My current research focuses on multiple network inference problems. In particular, I am interested in analyzing networks through spectral properties of their adjacency matrices. Under the Random Dot Product Graph model, networks are characterized by latent vectors associated with each vertex in the graph. Edge presence is then modeled as a Bernoulli random variable with probability given by the dot product of the two latent vectors associated with the edge. Adopting this low-rank model, we transform often difficult network analysis problems into problems that exist in low dimensional Euclidean space where most statistical techniques can be utilized. 

While there is a wide body of reseach studying embeddings in the single network setting, the study of simultaneous embeddings in the multiple graph setting is in its infancy. Recently, embeddings for multiple networks with a common latent position structure have been studied. In the presence of heterogenous networks, however, these techniques are less understood. In my research, we look to analyze the bias-variance tradeoff introduced by these embeddings in the multiple network setting.

<h3>Treelet Smoothers</h3>
<p>
This project focuses on improving the estimates of large, sparse covariance matrices. In several applications, practitioners believe that the correlation between their samples should be relatively low. In practice, however, it is common that samples may be clustered into small homogeneous sets throughout the sample. For example, in large medical studies it is quite common that entire families will participate. While across the dataset there is low correlative structure, the dataset still consists of small closely clustered individuals. To leverage this structure, we use Treelets to construct a smoothed estimate of the covariance matrix through iteratively constructing a basis that more naturally captures the variance in the dataset. Once this is done, we smooth the estimate by thresholding the eigenvalues in this new basis to encourage a parsimonious structure. With several applications in statistical genetics, we used Treelet Smoothers to improve the estimate of distant relatedness.
