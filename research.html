<h3>Multiple Graph Embeddings</h3>
<p> My current research focuses on multiple network inference problems. In particular, I am interested in analyzing random networks through their spectral properties. Under the Random Dot Product Graph model, networks are characteristized by latent vectors associated with each vertex in the graph. Edge presence is then modeled as a Bernoulli random variable with probability given by the dot product of the two latent vectors associated with the edge. Adopting this low-rank model, we transform often difficult network analysis problems into problems that exist in low dimensional Euclidean space where most statistical techniques can be utilized. 

There exists spectral statistics that are consistent estimators of the latent positions with accompanying central limit theorem statements that provide asymptotic variances. Recently, these statistics have been utilized in the analysis of multiple networks where each network has a common latent position structure. When this latent position structure differs across networks, however, these tools break down. In my research, we look to analyze the bias introduced by existing statistics in this multiple network setting and hope to understand the ramifications of jointing embedding networks into a common vector space.

<h3>Treelet Smoothers</h3>
<p>
This project focuses on improving the estimates of large, sparse covariance matrices. In several applications, practitioners believe that the correlation between their samples should be relatively low. In practice, however, it is common that samples may be clustered into small homogeneous sets throughout the dataset. For example, in large medical studies it is quite common that entire families will participate. While across the dataset there is low correlative structure, the dataset still consists of small closely clustered individuals. To leverage this structure, we use Treelets to construct a smoothed estimate of the covariance matrix through iteratively constructing a basis that more naturally captures the variance in the dataset. Once this is done, we smooth the estimate by thresholding the eigenvalues in this new basis to encourage a parsimonious structure. With several applications in statistical genetics, we used Treelet Smoothers to improve the estimate of distant relatedness.
